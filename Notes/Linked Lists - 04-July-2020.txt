Linked Lists
------------
A Linked list is a collection of elements stored in non-continuous memory locations in the form 
of nodes 

Node => Divided into two parts : element value and link/next to the next node

	Refer diagram Linked List.png

Arrays vs LinkedList
--------------------
- In Arrays the elements are stored in continuous memory locations where as in LinkedList the
  elements are stored in non-continuous memory locations in the form of nodes

- Arrays are fixed size where as Linked Lists are variable size (not fixed)

- The cost of insert and delete operations are more in Arrays where as the cost of these operations
  are less in LinkedList

- Arrays occupies less memory than Linked Lists

WAP to do the following Linked List operations

	1. Create
	2. Display
	3. Insert Begin
	4. Insert Middle
	5. Delete Begin
	6. Delete Middle
	7. Delete End
	8. Count
	9. Exit

	The menu should display repeatly until the user chooses Exit
