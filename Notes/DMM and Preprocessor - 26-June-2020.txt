Dynamic Memory Management (DMM)
-------------------------------
DMM is done using the following functions

- malloc() => used to allocate a block of memory
- realloc() => used to modify the allocated memory
- calloc() => used to allocate multiple blocks of memory
- free() => used to delete the allocated memory

	Refer program DMM.c

Preprocessors
-------------
Preprocessor is compiled before the actual compiler compiles the source code

Types
-----
- Macros		=> #define
- File Inclusion	=> #include


Macros
------
#define PI 3.14

eg:
#define cube(x) x*x*x //macro
main()
{
   printf("cube(3) = %d",cube(3));//cube(3) will get replaced 3*3*3 before compilation
}
cube(int x)
{
  return x*x*x;
}
Macros vs Functions
-------------------
- In case of Macros the code gets replaced before compilation where as in case of
  functions, the function is called during program execution


File inclusion
--------------
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

Creating user defined header files
----------------------------------
	Refer programs
		- mylib.h (create only functions without main() )
		- fileinclusion.c (run)
