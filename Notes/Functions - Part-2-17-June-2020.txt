Recursion
---------
Calling the same function within itself is called as recursion

eg:
	main()
	{
	    ...
	    main();
	    ...
	}

WAP to find the factorial of a given number using recursion
	Refer program FactRecursion.c


Storage Classes
---------------
Storage classes are used to give the scope(avaiable) and storage of the variable

Types
-----
- Automatic / Local Variables
	- auto keyword (optional)
	- variables are declared within the function
	- scope of the variables are within the function only

		Refer program LocalVar.c

- External / Global Variables
	- extern keyword (optional)
	- variables are declared outside the functions
	- scope of the variables are to all functions of the program

		Refer program GlobalVar.c

- static variables
	- static keyword
	- default value is zero
	- retains the value of variable present in memory

		Refer program StaticVar.c

- register variables
	- register keyword
	- variables are stored in register memory (a part of RAM)
	- performance of register variables are more than local variables
	- register variables are used in system programming

		eg:
			register int n;//n variable is created in register memory
