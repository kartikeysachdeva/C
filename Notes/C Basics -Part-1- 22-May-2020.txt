DOCUMENTATION SECTION

	eg:
		#define PI 3.14

LINKAGE SECTION
	- used to link to external header files (.h files)
	#include <stdio.h> //standard input output header files / libraries (existing code)
	
GLOBAL DECLARATION SECTION
	- the variables are used in all functions of the program

main() => entry point to run a C program
{
    Declaration Part => used to allocate memory space for variables
    Executable Part  => read input, display , process
}
SUB PROGRAM SECTION
function-1()
function-2()
...
...
function-n()
