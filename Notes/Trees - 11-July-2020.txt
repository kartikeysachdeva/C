Trees
-----
A tree is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes

	Refer diagram Trees.png

Root Node : Root node is the starting node of a tree which is the base for each and every other nodes
 		of the tree

Siblings : The nodes which have the same parent are called as siblings

Leaf Nodes : The nodes which are not having any children


Order of a node : The number of children present to a node 

Height of a tree : The maximum possible length from the root node to the leaf node

Binary Tree
-----------
The trees is which every node contains atmost two childern

	Refer diagram Binary Tree.png

Tree Traversals
---------------
Accessing / visiting every element of tree is called traversal

Binary Search Tree
-----------------
If the element is < root node => connect left
If the element is > root node => connect right

Types
-----
- preorder traversal
	- visit the root node
	- visit the left node
	- visit the right node

- inorder traversal
	- visit the left node
	- visit the root node
	- visit the right node

- postorder traversal
	- visit the left node
	- visit the right node
	- visit the root node
